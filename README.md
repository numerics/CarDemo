Car Demo using Edmunds API


This is a simple app to highlight several features.
1) Several uses of UICollections
2) Mapping the API(Edmunds) properties via Objective-C introspection
    a) The process is to add properties to the class with the names of the Json string in the API
    b) Make the addValuesToObjfromJsonDict call with a comma delited exclusion string... 
    
This can be seen in CDDealerData Class.

The Demo as design is far from complete... the client canceled after a week, but code is in there... not used, to add a Sonar capability that would find Dealers that offered Specials... it's a cool idea, that I will complete at onther time because I think this could be a model for attracting a lot of attention for many kinds of shopping.
